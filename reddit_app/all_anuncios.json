It\u2019s called : The Click-Magnetic Ad Formula.\u00a0\n\n\n\nToday I\u2019m going to walk you through the entire process right here in this post. You don\u2019t need to optin, give me your personal details or anything like that.\n\n\n\nThis works for lead generation campaigns (VSLs, Webinars, Events) which has been my bread and butter but it also works for sale campaigns (digital products, low ticket stuff, saas, subscriptions) and even ecom (physical products) with some adjusting of course.  \n  \nBut before we get started there are some things I want to say:  \n  \n\n\n* This process evolves continuously, all the time. I am not saying it\u2019s the \u201cbest\u201d or that there is \u201cbest\u201d. This is NOT the only way of doing it. It\u2019s what I use and what I know how to do. I\u2019m always open to a conversation in the comments and learning from other people. There will be things that will be missing from the post. Its impossible to cover every single detail and every possible situation.\n* I\u2019m obviously incentivised to talk about these things. First, I like what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m passionate about it so I like talking about it. Second, I sell courses and coaching to people that want to get better or get started. I dont feel like it\u2019s right for me to hide this.\u00a0\n* This post assumes that you have the basics covered and more. You know metrics, what they means and what effect they have. Unfortunately I can\u2019t explain everything in a post because it needs to be thousands of words long.\n* The hard truth is that having a media buying process is great but unfortunately not enough these days. You need to know business strategy, copywriting and tech as well. Media buying is one of the things but without the other things you might not be able to achieve the final goal - more money.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWith that being said\u2026\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get started\u2026\n\n\n\nThe Click-Magnetic Ad Formula is a process with 4 phases that allows us to clearly identify variables that work and those that don\u2019t. Each phase have a launch and optimisation process.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBasically, we test different variables, we find winning combinations that are within KPI and this leads to business growth.\n\n\n\nTo be able to do it\u2026\n\n\n\n* \u00a0 You need to know **ALL the variables** that you can test (I will explain all the variables when it comes to naming conventions).\n* \u00a0 You need to know the **level of impact each variable has** on performance and **be able to prioritise them**\n* \u00a0 You need to know **how to test a variable** and analyse results to identify winning variables\n* \u00a0 You need to know **how to allocate budget** in most efficient way so you get maximum results while at the same time have a backup plan to not lose the account if something breaks tomorrow\n\n\n\nWe start in Phase 1 - Campaign Variable Launch Test.\n\n\n\nDuring this phase we want to test our campaigns **theme\\\\angle\\\\idea\\\\message.**\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is where you MUST be creative. We want to find out what is important for our target market. What resonates with them or which of these messages work. If I am selling an iPhone - do I talk about the camera or the display or something else.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnother example\u2026\n\n\n\nNot too long ago I was in the market for hiking shoes. Myself and my fiancee love going hiking from time to time. As someone thats been in hiking for a while I have used a variety of different shoes. Most hiking shoes have goretex technology. This makes them waterproof. However it also makes your fees sweat way more than usual which is something that I dont like. Eventually I bought a pair that were waterproof but without goretex. They have their own proprietary waterproof mechanism, their own comfort mechanism and so on.  \n  \nIf I was to run an ad to myself, I would create one meta campaign only about the waterproof mechanism, one about the comfort mechanism, one about the superior durability and one just about the offer.\n\n\n\nSo that is 4 different meta campaigns/ideas/angles/themes/ messages that I would test.\n\n\n\nMake sense?\n\n\n\nGood.\n\n  \nSo how do we test this exactly?\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou create as many campaigns as angles you are going to test and set the budget to 2xKPI and let it run until it spends 6XKPI - which should be 3 days of non stop delivery. The reason why I say let it spend 6xKPI and not let it run for 3 days is because if for some reason it hasn\u2019t spend 6XKPI then it hasn\u2019t been 3 days. Time is only measured when the budget is spend.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd thats it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThats how you launch your first test. Now let it spend, dont touch it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI manage the ads always at the same time which is around 8AM UK time.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo when creating everything I will make it start at 8AM the next day. Always schedule for the next day so they have all spend equally. This is a MUST so when you are optimising you can optimise everything.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen 6XKPI is spend and you need to optimise you only ask yourself one questions - IS IT WITHIN KPI OR NOT?\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s not - switch it off.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s within KPI will move to Phase 2 - Ad Variable Testing\n\n\n\nBefore we continue to Phase 2 - I am going to explain how we name things and all the variables.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo make it easier, we are going to divide all the variables in 3 categories.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCampaign Level Variables - these variables are what we test in Phase 1 (what I explained above) and it\u2019s a bit weird so let me clarify it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe name of the campaign is - Phase 1 - Angle - Objective.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo if selling iPhone - Phase 1 - Camera Feature - Sales\n\n\n\nAll the campaigns will have the same name except the angle - which is what you are testing.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no such setting as angle on the campaign level. On the campaign level you can basically just pick if it is a CBO or not and the objective.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe angle can be tested by 2 variables - visual creative or the body copy (even headline).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat means, Phase 1 testing is actually done on the ad level by changing copy, headline or visual creative.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhy is it on the campaign level then?\u00a0\n\n\n\nBecause it is the biggest, most important test. It is what the entire campaign is about. Thats why.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCool.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s continue about the naming conventions.\u00a0\n\n\n\nName of the campaign -\u00a0 Phase 1 - Angle - Objective.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHere are the adset variables:\n\n\n\nI - Interest/Audience/Detailed Targeting\n\nPI - Placement\n\nL - Location\n\nAg - Age\n\nG - Gender\n\n\n\nName of the adset - - P1-(Waterproof)-Sales-I-Broad-Pl-auto-L-usa/uk/eu-Ag-28/65-  \nG-m/f-(V1)-H1-In1-C1-B1\n\n\n\nThe name of the adset start with the name of the campaign first and then we add all the variables at the adset level plus the name of the ad.\n\n\n\nThen we add the name of the ad as well. I always do one ad per adset because if I test multiple ads - Meta picks one randomly and spend everything on it. I avoid allowing Meta do ever do what they want or think it is right. Test everything individually.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAd variables:  \n  \nV - Visual Creative\n\nH - Headline\n\nIn - Lead/Hook/Intro\n\nC - Body Copy\n\nB - Button\n\n\n\nName of an ad:\u00a0\n\n\n\n(V1)-H1-In1-C1-B1\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this is quite the thing to wrap your head around for some.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBasically, it\u2019s every single variable possible in the name of the adsets and the ads. Adsets and ads have the same name. The variable that is being tested is in brackets () so it\u2019s very easy to see what is being tested exactly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMakes sense?\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo now the winners of Phase 1 go to Phase 2 which is\u2026?\n\n\n\nAd variables testing. I shared with you all the variables above. They are organised by importance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow you might be asking\u2026\u201dbut why?\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy not test something else instead.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo explain this using Logic, I will share my 10 Golden Media Buying Rules.\n\n\n\n1. \u00a0 Always spend the most on what is already proven. Allocate the most budget in P4&gt;P3&gt;P2&gt;\u20bd1\n2. \u00a0 Hitting KPI's is always more important than testing.\n3. \u00a0 Always keep testing to keep your risk low and diversify your ad portfolio.\n4. \u00a0 This way if something stops working suddenly you don't lose the entire account\n5. \u00a0 Never switch something that is working well OFF.\n6. \u00a0 Never make drastic/fast decisions/changes. All changes need to be slow, methodical and well calculated.\n7. \u00a0 Every time you try to make something better it might end up being worse.\n8. \u00a0 Don't touch if you don't have to.\n9. \u00a0 Focus on the big picture - campaign level/overall results.\n\n\n\n\n\nCool?\n\n\n\nBecause we had something proven in Phase 1, now we want to perform our next test ON it and not start a brand new test in Phase 1 and because visual creative is the biggest needle mover\u2026we want to test that next.\n\n\n\nSo we are going to test visual creatives next.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is your image, video. The thing everyone is testing the most.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe way I want you to think about that is\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay now I know what they want me to talk about. What is the best way to say it?\u201d Is it a video, is it an image, is it white background vs green background.\n\n\n\nHere are the 7 most common image ads I would use:\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. Benefit Driven - Only text - One sentence (I use this in Phase 1)\n2. Heavily Edited - edited by a designer type of an ad\n3. Mystery Ad - ad where you pixelate the faces of the people or draw a red circle to make it look like there is something in the background when there isnt\u00a0\n4. Product Ad - showing the product or how it is used\n5. Native/Hidden Ad - just a photo with no editing - it doesn\u2019t look like an ad\n6. Meme/Stock Image or something trendy - run ads with something that is viral or in the news right now (will smith slap, hawk tuah girl).\n7. Process/Map - show them a process or a map or something like that.\n\n\n\nHere are the 7 most common video ads I would use:\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. Text based - keynote or powerpoint presentation (one of my favourites - dont need to show yourself, easy to create)\n2. Selfie modified - Selfie using an app that adds subtitles and different effects\n3. Youtube style/ familiar place - if you live in a city with famous buildings or just good looking views you can stand in front of it and shoot a video there.\n4. Youtube style - talking head\n5. Selfie video native - selfie video that is not edited in any way or maybe just a lil bit\n6. Middle of the action - the ad start while there is something going on on the screen - like running\u00a0\n7. Stock video\n\n\n\nYou choose how many creatives you wanna test based on your available budget.\n\n\n\nYou set the budget and schedule the same way as Phase 1. You also optimise the same way.\n\n\n\nAnything that is within KPI will then move to Phase 3 - adset variable testing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBefore we continue a few words about phase 3. Phase 3 is considered by beginners the most valuable test. It\u2019s your targeting. The demographics you want to use. It\u2019s not their fault because it used to be the most important.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy entire media buying process when I started was all about the targeting. So I would test pretty much only interests. This is not required anymore.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou see, with all the tracking scandals and IOS 14 and all of that stuff, Meta have switched from providing targeting options to their advertisers to actually taking them away. You have less interests and they are more inaccurate.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNot only that but Meta are trying to make their advantage+ audiences (which basically allows them to show the ads to people outside of your audience) mandatory.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll of that basically means that accurate targeting is slowly being phased out and is less important than ever. Thats why this is the 3rd test and not the first like it used to be, for me at least.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat being said\u2026interests is still the most important variable on the adset level, following closely by placements.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo far in phases 1 and 2 there has been no significant difference in how we launch and optimise. The process is the same.\n\n\n\nIn phase 3, when testing interests, the process of launching and optimising is different.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nBecause interests is the ONLY variable that you can test again and again. There is an unlimited amount of interests that you can test. Sometimes you can test something completely unrelated and it can still work.\n\n\n\nCool?\n\n\n\nSo how do we launch this baby?\n\n\n\nPick winners from Phase 2 or anything that works\u2026\n\n\n\nStart testing interests one by one.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBudget is 1xKPI and we let it run until it spends 3xKPI.\n\n\n\nTest 5-6 interests at least.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s really bad you can kill it at 3 interests.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou always want to have between 2-6 adsets.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHere you can start adding more ads per adset.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe havent done this so far because we were testing ad variables (we do that even in Phase 1 even though the process makes it look like it\u2019s a campaign test).\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow that we test adset elements and all the ad elements have been tested already - you can add multiple ads per adset. Here we are giving the algorithm some freedom. This is not necessary but I like doing it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo\u2026\n\n\n\nPhase 3 Interest testing - budget is smaller giving us more control and you want to test more adsets with different interests. It\u2019s quite different compared to phase 1 and 2.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOptimisation is also different.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBecause we are talking Phase 3 here - these ads have already been proven somewhat right? They wouldn\u2019t be here if they were not good.\n\n\n\nSo therefore our optimisation process is a lot more forgiving.\n\n\n\nHere it is\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n* Look at last 3 days - if it\u2019s within KPI - let it run. If its not\u2026\n* Check today (most up to date data) - within KPI - leave it. If its not\u2026\n* Check yesterday - within KPI - leave it. If not\u2026\n* Check maximum - Here we have 2 paths we can take. If you run adsets with multiple ads in them and they have 1 conversion during the first 3 day testing period - check if you can optimise on the ad level - if you can - optimise and leave it. If you can't optimise on the ad level - kill it\n* If you don't run multiple ads per adset and its good on maximum - give it another chance by checking the last 4 days. If it's within or close to KPI - check last 7,14,21,30 or whatever days. Ask yourself...\" does this adset deserve a last chance?\"If yes - leave it. If no - KILL IT.\n\n\n\nMakes sense?\n\n\n\nAny other variable from Phase 3 is treated the same way as a test from phase 1 and 2. Only interests are different.\n\n\n\nPublishing in P3 is also a little different. In phases 1 and 2 we launch ads and we let them run for 6XKPI - then we kill anything that is not within or close to KPI. In phase 3 because optimisation is different - publishing is also different.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOne of the rules here says that we always want to spend the most on what is already proven. That means that, at this point, we want to be spending more on P3 compared to other phases. That is not always possible of course - it depends on the results you get from previous tests. So here's how to publish new ads in Phase 3...\n\n\n\nFirst thing we need to do is see how many adsets will be running tomorrow. We call these guaranteed. Check today - if it is within KPI you can select it as guarantee. This means that we know for a fact that this adset won't be optimised tomorrow. If its not within KPI we are going to check the last 2,5 days including\n\ntoday.\n\n\n\nAnd then you are going to ask yourself the very important questions:\n\n\n\n\"If results remain the same, would I let that run tomorrow or would I optimise it?\"\n\n\n\nSelect it as a guarantee if you would let it run. Then you need to check how many guarantees you have of this creative. We want to have a minimum if its not working well but no less than 2 adsets and we want to have up to 6 maximum if its working well. You add as many new adsets as needed depending on the performance. Make sure the creative you are adding is not already scaled in Phase 4 scaling campaign. When something is in a scaling campaign you stop adding it here or anywhere for that matter.\n\n\n\nAnd thats it with Phase 3\u2026\n\n\n\nI know this is a lot but we are almost there\u2026\n\n\n\nPhase 4 - Scaling\n\n\n\nSo far we should have:  \n  \n\n\n* An angle that works - discoverable in Phase 1\n* \u00a0 A visual creative that works - discoverable in Phase 2\n* \u00a0 A few interests that work - discoverable in Phase 3\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these are the main building blocks of a scaling campaign.\n\n\n\nWe start by finding what has been working consistently well in Phase 3.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen we need to decide what type of CBO we are going to create - this depends on what we have available.\n\n\n\nThe 3 types of scaling CBO campaigns are:\n\n\n\n1. \u00a0 One creative with the 3 best possible interests - lets say we have a creative that is working really well - you simply select the 3 best interests and create a new CBO campaign. This will allow Meta to spend the budget however it sees fit across these 3 different interests. Because these 3 interests are already proven we can now allow Meta to do whatever it wants.\n2. \u00a0 Multiple good creatives - we can do 2 good creatives with 2 interests each.\n3. \u00a0 BROAD CBO - If we want to scale more we can do a massive daily budget with a cost cap. This tells facebook that it can spend as much as it wants from the huge daily budget as long as the cost per result is below our goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo...Based on the current situation inside of the account you can decide which one of these options you wanna pick. Bare in mind that in many cases, even though everything was tested and done according to the click magnetic process, every time you try to scale there is a chance that it will break.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMeaning that, there is no guarantee that your scaling attempt will be successful.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThats why when it comes to scaling I prefer calling it a scaling attempt.\n\n\n\nWe let the CBO run for 3 days with whatever daily budget we have set. You will see I dont say 3xKPI or anything like that. Reason being is that the budget of the CBO can be significantly higher. Let is spend for 3 days.\n\n\n\n* \u00a0 Then go ahead and check yesterday. If its good - leave it.\n* \u00a0 If its not - check today.\n* \u00a0 If not - check the day before yesterday.\n* \u00a0 If not check last 7,14,30 or whatever days.\n* \u00a0 We really wanna find a reason for this to live.\n* \u00a0 We are not trying to get rid of it fast. The opposite. We want it to live.\n\n\n\nAnd thats it\u2026\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\n\n\n* \u00a0 Your goal as a media buyer is to spend the advertising budget you have access to in the best possible way\n* \u00a0 You are essentially an investor on behalf of your client (or yourself)\n* \u00a0 Your goal is to identify variables that will deliver a campaign within KPI\n* \u00a0 The Click-magnetic media buying process is a 4 phase process designed to identify winning variables\n* \u00a0 Phase 1 is message/angle/idea\n* \u00a0 Phase 2 is ad variables test (visual, headline, copy and etc.)\n* \u00a0 Phase 3 is adset variable test (targeting, interests, age, gender...)\n* \u00a0 Phase 4 is a scaling CBO campaign\n* \u00a0 Every phase has 2 processes in it - publishing and optimisation.\n* \u00a0 They vary depending on the phase (some are the same)\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGood luck",

Great game but that's not what I'm here about. \n\nFinal Fantasy 9 lets you pause the game whenever you want. During exploration, overworld exploration, battles, boss battles and even all the cutscenes. You can press start and the game will just stop executing with a PAUSE screen overlayed on it. \n\nIt seems a minor thing but this is a great feature. Gamers are human beings with things to do outside of gaming. Having the possibility to PAUSE is an incredible quality of life feature. \n\nI notice that many modern have a problem with this. Especially cutscenes, you often aren't allowed to pause them and have to sit through or skip them. There is no reason why a single player game shouldn't have a \"pause anytime\" feature. \n\nWhat other games have this? ",

At the beginning, it \"overwhelms\" you with a hard to navigate world and a lot of characters who want a lot of things, but because of that, you never focus completely on one task (like collecting shells for example), so you just run around, meet friends, have fun, and progress whatever goals you've set for yourself. The music is gorgeous, the graphics are nice, and the writing ranges from beautiful and melancholic to genuinely hilarious (a guy gives you rumors, on the third interaction, he says \"wanna hear some rumors?\" you say yes, then he says \"im out\" and you say \"its ok\" which is very different from the gamey omniscient hint systems we've gotten in games). You become more capable of moving around, create shortcuts with the stuff you acquire along the way, and learn the layout of this wonderful little world in 1-3 hours. I highly recommend it.\n\n  \nedit: Just wanted to add, it's the closest a game's ever gotten to the Studio Ghibli vibe, in my experience. Another reason to play it lol",

After filming, director Mike Cheslik painstakingly executed over 1500 effects shots on his home computer.\n\nAfter a virtual premiere at Fantastic Fest in 2022, the movie gained steam on the festival circuit, picking up a slew of awards including an audience award at Fantasia 2023. With no major offers from distributors, the filmmakers decided to self-release the film, starting with the \"Great Lakes Roadshow\" in early 2024: a 14-day tour of the Midwest which sold out most screens, including a 700+ audience at the Music Box in Chicago. The show hearkened back to early vaudeville, with Mike Cheslik roasting the audience and the movies star / producer / co-writer Ryland Tews body-slamming beavers.\n\nThe New York Times picked up the story, and from there Hundreds of Beavers became an unexpected cult hit in cinemas across the country. So far it has played on over 250 screens (we only showed up to 26 of em), and is currently premiering in the UK, Australia, Taiwan, and more.\n\nTo get the film on VOD, we partnered with FilmHub, a distribution company that allows filmmakers to keep their rights, for transactional video on demand via Amazon and Apple. We also brokered a partnership with Fandor for subscription streaming.\n\nWe are also proud to announce that **Hundreds of Beavers** will be the FIRST FILM to be screened at the LIBRARY OF CONGRESS in the same year as its theatrical release. Saturday, July 27th.\n\nWe will attempt to screen in movie theaters as long as fans want it.

        "selftext": "Usually when a sequel comes around, you expect to see the same main and supporting characters show up, especially if they're popular. But sometimes the creators can't think of anything for those characters to do in the new plot they've come up with, or there's new characters competing for screentime, or maybe the actors are just too busy.\n\nAs such, the old characters are there basically out of obligation, but don't actually get to do anything important, or are much less important than they used to be. This is especially a problem in movie series with huge ensemble casts. Sometimes they just show up for a cameo near the end of the movie and only have a few lines of dialogue, and sometimes they show up for a cameo at the start of the movie solely to die.\n\nSo what movie characters just became irrelevant in sequels?",

I really thought the baby noises were such a key component of the infantilizing nature of being an oligarch, the condescension of corporate copy, that I couldn't imagine the scene any other way. This was after being told repeatedly what a singular, personal vision Phil Tippett had for the entire project. Made me wonder how much else of the movie was essentially him taking suggestions from his crew over the years. \n\nIt's kind of a cliche that movies are a collaborative medium, but this is one where one of the keystones of a movie came from a technician whose name I can't even remember offhand.",

I didn't know this was a Kubrick movie. I'm sure he wouldn't want me to know either. I read about the troubled production of this masterpiece. Kubrick clashed with everyone. Kirk Douglas was very involved wih both direction and production.\n\n\nSpeaking of Douglas, he looks so feeble and weary in the begining of the movie. Truely like a wrinkled and sun beaten slave. Hell of a performance he gave. Anytime he tears up he burns you to the core with those glistening blue eyes.\n\n\nThe OST is so distinctively memorable. Especially the love theme of Spartacus. That melancholic flute that has been sampled hundreds of times.\n\n\nThere were so many extras in this. Holy shit. That war scene where the Roman legions are marching to formation is spine chilling. There are so many people.\n\n\nMan, what an emotional story. Shakespearean. Gut wrenching. Perhaps one of the most legendary tales of defeat in media. It was difficult to not weep after the war scenes. It's just sadness after sadness. Also the death of &gt;!Draba &amp; Antonious are both really impactful. The staredown in the waiting booth between Draba &amp; Spartacus is just torture when you know the context!&lt;\n\n\nYou know, it's odd how for such a recognizable name like Spartacus and the message of that story, all the modern interpretations put their focus on the sex and gladiatorial combat aspects.\n\n\n\nI also did some reading on the side about the historical Spartacus and the Third Servile War. It's fascinating that such a forgotten and poorly recorded event in history would have such an immense ripple effect through culture and arts years later.",

I'm not sure what changes they made to the algorithm, or why for that matter, but whatever they did it has nearly crippled my ability to discover new music, save for Discover Weekly. Even then though, it feels like DW has been missing a lot more than it hits lately too.\n\nAt least Release Radar still got me. Can't fuck up new releases from artists I follow. Would have to be some of the worst coders on the planet to mess that one up.\n\nEDIT: Clearing the cache has improved things significantly, along with turning off automix. Spotify is trying to cut on server costs by caching the songs on your device and then replaying them endlessly, all while increasing prices.

My wife said no orgy music eventhough no one would know the title. I think the opening tracks are so powerful when you hear them back to back with no visual cues. I'm curious how many of you are big soundtrack fans  and how you all rate this one. I've got others I'd discuss but I don't want to go in too many different direction. BUT, the 1986 highlander soundtrack is another favorite. I mean a movie soundtrack by QUEEN?! Intetested  to hear your thoughts. ",

        "selftext": "To All Whom It May Concern:\n\nFor fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit\u2019s most-popular communities. That time hasn\u2019t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we\u2019ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit\u2019s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools\u2019 Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We\u2019ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven\u2019t been completely happy about every change that we\u2019ve witnessed, we\u2019ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. \n\nThis process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.\n\nOn June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit\u2019s API; changes which \u2013 despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors \u2013 threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit\u2019s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. \n\nWe acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. \n\nHowever, we have the following requests:\n\n- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.\n- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.\n- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.\n- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.\n- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.\n- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.\n- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit\u2019s User Agreement and Reddit\u2019s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators\u2019 behavior. \n- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of \"Moderator Advocate\" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.\n\nReddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood \u2013 its multitude of moderators and contributors \u2013 consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform\u2019s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit\u2019s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. \n\nThat trust has been all but entirely eroded\u2026 but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.\n\nIn simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. \n\nWe look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.\n\nThere\u2019s also just [one other thing](https://i.imgur.com/xLmTxcR.jpg).",
