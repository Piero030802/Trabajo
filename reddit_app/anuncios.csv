Learn how to run Meta Ads from one post…,nmvalkov,20,10,2024-07-13 05:17:11,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1e22iwl/learn_how_to_run_meta_ads_from_one_post/,20,0,"Hi everyone. I’ve been running ads since 2018. Since then, I have created a specific step by step process that I use to launch, optimise and scale ad campaigns. It’s called : The Click-Magnetic Ad Formula. 



Today I’m going to walk you through the entire process right here in this post. You don’t need to optin, give me your personal details or anything like that.



This works for lead generation campaigns (VSLs, Webinars, Events) which has been my bread and butter but it also works for sale campaigns (digital products, low ticket stuff, saas, subscriptions) and even ecom (physical products) with some adjusting of course.  
  
But before we get started there are some things I want to say:  
  


* This process evolves continuously, all the time. I am not saying it’s the “best” or that there is “best”. This is NOT the only way of doing it. It’s what I use and what I know how to do. I’m always open to a conversation in the comments and learning from other people. There will be things that will be missing from the post. Its impossible to cover every single detail and every possible situation.
* I’m obviously incentivised to talk about these things. First, I like what I’m doing and I’m passionate about it so I like talking about it. Second, I sell courses and coaching to people that want to get better or get started. I dont feel like it’s right for me to hide this. 
* This post assumes that you have the basics covered and more. You know metrics, what they means and what effect they have. Unfortunately I can’t explain everything in a post because it needs to be thousands of words long.
* The hard truth is that having a media buying process is great but unfortunately not enough these days. You need to know business strategy, copywriting and tech as well. Media buying is one of the things but without the other things you might not be able to achieve the final goal - more money. 



With that being said…



Let’s get started…



The Click-Magnetic Ad Formula is a process with 4 phases that allows us to clearly identify variables that work and those that don’t. Each phase have a launch and optimisation process. 



Basically, we test different variables, we find winning combinations that are within KPI and this leads to business growth.



To be able to do it…



*   You need to know **ALL the variables** that you can test (I will explain all the variables when it comes to naming conventions).
*   You need to know the **level of impact each variable has** on performance and **be able to prioritise them**
*   You need to know **how to test a variable** and analyse results to identify winning variables
*   You need to know **how to allocate budget** in most efficient way so you get maximum results while at the same time have a backup plan to not lose the account if something breaks tomorrow



We start in Phase 1 - Campaign Variable Launch Test.



During this phase we want to test our campaigns **theme\\angle\\idea\\message.** 



This is where you MUST be creative. We want to find out what is important for our target market. What resonates with them or which of these messages work. If I am selling an iPhone - do I talk about the camera or the display or something else. 



Another example…



Not too long ago I was in the market for hiking shoes. Myself and my fiancee love going hiking from time to time. As someone thats been in hiking for a while I have used a variety of different shoes. Most hiking shoes have goretex technology. This makes them waterproof. However it also makes your fees sweat way more than usual which is something that I dont like. Eventually I bought a pair that were waterproof but without goretex. They have their own proprietary waterproof mechanism, their own comfort mechanism and so on.  
  
If I was to run an ad to myself, I would create one meta campaign only about the waterproof mechanism, one about the comfort mechanism, one about the superior durability and one just about the offer.



So that is 4 different meta campaigns/ideas/angles/themes/ messages that I would test.



Make sense?



Good.

  
So how do we test this exactly? 



You create as many campaigns as angles you are going to test and set the budget to 2xKPI and let it run until it spends 6XKPI - which should be 3 days of non stop delivery. The reason why I say let it spend 6xKPI and not let it run for 3 days is because if for some reason it hasn’t spend 6XKPI then it hasn’t been 3 days. Time is only measured when the budget is spend. 



And thats it. 



Thats how you launch your first test. Now let it spend, dont touch it. 



I manage the ads always at the same time which is around 8AM UK time. 



So when creating everything I will make it start at 8AM the next day. Always schedule for the next day so they have all spend equally. This is a MUST so when you are optimising you can optimise everything. 



When 6XKPI is spend and you need to optimise you only ask yourself one questions - IS IT WITHIN KPI OR NOT?



What’s not - switch it off. 



What’s within KPI will move to Phase 2 - Ad Variable Testing



Before we continue to Phase 2 - I am going to explain how we name things and all the variables. 



To make it easier, we are going to divide all the variables in 3 categories. 



Campaign Level Variables - these variables are what we test in Phase 1 (what I explained above) and it’s a bit weird so let me clarify it. 



The name of the campaign is - Phase 1 - Angle - Objective. 



So if selling iPhone - Phase 1 - Camera Feature - Sales



All the campaigns will have the same name except the angle - which is what you are testing.



However, there is no such setting as angle on the campaign level. On the campaign level you can basically just pick if it is a CBO or not and the objective. 



The angle can be tested by 2 variables - visual creative or the body copy (even headline). 



That means, Phase 1 testing is actually done on the ad level by changing copy, headline or visual creative. 



Why is it on the campaign level then? 



Because it is the biggest, most important test. It is what the entire campaign is about. Thats why. 



Cool. 



Now let’s continue about the naming conventions. 



Name of the campaign -  Phase 1 - Angle - Objective. 



Here are the adset variables:



I - Interest/Audience/Detailed Targeting

PI - Placement

L - Location

Ag - Age

G - Gender



Name of the adset - - P1-(Waterproof)-Sales-I-Broad-Pl-auto-L-usa/uk/eu-Ag-28/65-  
G-m/f-(V1)-H1-In1-C1-B1



The name of the adset start with the name of the campaign first and then we add all the variables at the adset level plus the name of the ad.



Then we add the name of the ad as well. I always do one ad per adset because if I test multiple ads - Meta picks one randomly and spend everything on it. I avoid allowing Meta do ever do what they want or think it is right. Test everything individually. 



Ad variables:  
  
V - Visual Creative

H - Headline

In - Lead/Hook/Intro

C - Body Copy

B - Button



Name of an ad: 



(V1)-H1-In1-C1-B1





I know this is quite the thing to wrap your head around for some. 



Basically, it’s every single variable possible in the name of the adsets and the ads. Adsets and ads have the same name. The variable that is being tested is in brackets () so it’s very easy to see what is being tested exactly. 



Makes sense? 



So now the winners of Phase 1 go to Phase 2 which is…?



Ad variables testing. I shared with you all the variables above. They are organised by importance. 



Now you might be asking…”but why?”



Why not test something else instead. 



To explain this using Logic, I will share my 10 Golden Media Buying Rules.



1.   Always spend the most on what is already proven. Allocate the most budget in P4&gt;P3&gt;P2&gt;₽1
2.   Hitting KPI's is always more important than testing.
3.   Always keep testing to keep your risk low and diversify your ad portfolio.
4.   This way if something stops working suddenly you don't lose the entire account
5.   Never switch something that is working well OFF.
6.   Never make drastic/fast decisions/changes. All changes need to be slow, methodical and well calculated.
7.   Every time you try to make something better it might end up being worse.
8.   Don't touch if you don't have to.
9.   Focus on the big picture - campaign level/overall results.





Cool?



Because we had something proven in Phase 1, now we want to perform our next test ON it and not start a brand new test in Phase 1 and because visual creative is the biggest needle mover…we want to test that next.



So we are going to test visual creatives next. 



This is your image, video. The thing everyone is testing the most. 



The way I want you to think about that is…



“Okay now I know what they want me to talk about. What is the best way to say it?” Is it a video, is it an image, is it white background vs green background.



Here are the 7 most common image ads I would use: 



1. Benefit Driven - Only text - One sentence (I use this in Phase 1)
2. Heavily Edited - edited by a designer type of an ad
3. Mystery Ad - ad where you pixelate the faces of the people or draw a red circle to make it look like there is something in the background when there isnt 
4. Product Ad - showing the product or how it is used
5. Native/Hidden Ad - just a photo with no editing - it doesn’t look like an ad
6. Meme/Stock Image or something trendy - run ads with something that is viral or in the news right now (will smith slap, hawk tuah girl).
7. Process/Map - show them a process or a map or something like that.



Here are the 7 most common video ads I would use: 



1. Text based - keynote or powerpoint presentation (one of my favourites - dont need to show yourself, easy to create)
2. Selfie modified - Selfie using an app that adds subtitles and different effects
3. Youtube style/ familiar place - if you live in a city with famous buildings or just good looking views you can stand in front of it and shoot a video there.
4. Youtube style - talking head
5. Selfie video native - selfie video that is not edited in any way or maybe just a lil bit
6. Middle of the action - the ad start while there is something going on on the screen - like running 
7. Stock video



You choose how many creatives you wanna test based on your available budget.



You set the budget and schedule the same way as Phase 1. You also optimise the same way.



Anything that is within KPI will then move to Phase 3 - adset variable testing. 



Before we continue a few words about phase 3. Phase 3 is considered by beginners the most valuable test. It’s your targeting. The demographics you want to use. It’s not their fault because it used to be the most important. 



My entire media buying process when I started was all about the targeting. So I would test pretty much only interests. This is not required anymore. 



You see, with all the tracking scandals and IOS 14 and all of that stuff, Meta have switched from providing targeting options to their advertisers to actually taking them away. You have less interests and they are more inaccurate. 



Not only that but Meta are trying to make their advantage+ audiences (which basically allows them to show the ads to people outside of your audience) mandatory. 



All of that basically means that accurate targeting is slowly being phased out and is less important than ever. Thats why this is the 3rd test and not the first like it used to be, for me at least. 



That being said…interests is still the most important variable on the adset level, following closely by placements. 



So far in phases 1 and 2 there has been no significant difference in how we launch and optimise. The process is the same.



In phase 3, when testing interests, the process of launching and optimising is different. 



Why?



Because interests is the ONLY variable that you can test again and again. There is an unlimited amount of interests that you can test. Sometimes you can test something completely unrelated and it can still work.



Cool?



So how do we launch this baby?



Pick winners from Phase 2 or anything that works…



Start testing interests one by one. 



Budget is 1xKPI and we let it run until it spends 3xKPI.



Test 5-6 interests at least. 



If it’s really bad you can kill it at 3 interests. 



You always want to have between 2-6 adsets. 



Here you can start adding more ads per adset. 



We havent done this so far because we were testing ad variables (we do that even in Phase 1 even though the process makes it look like it’s a campaign test). 



Now that we test adset elements and all the ad elements have been tested already - you can add multiple ads per adset. Here we are giving the algorithm some freedom. This is not necessary but I like doing it. 



So…



Phase 3 Interest testing - budget is smaller giving us more control and you want to test more adsets with different interests. It’s quite different compared to phase 1 and 2. 



Optimisation is also different. 



Because we are talking Phase 3 here - these ads have already been proven somewhat right? They wouldn’t be here if they were not good.



So therefore our optimisation process is a lot more forgiving.



Here it is…





* Look at last 3 days - if it’s within KPI - let it run. If its not…
* Check today (most up to date data) - within KPI - leave it. If its not…
* Check yesterday - within KPI - leave it. If not…
* Check maximum - Here we have 2 paths we can take. If you run adsets with multiple ads in them and they have 1 conversion during the first 3 day testing period - check if you can optimise on the ad level - if you can - optimise and leave it. If you can't optimise on the ad level - kill it
* If you don't run multiple ads per adset and its good on maximum - give it another chance by checking the last 4 days. If it's within or close to KPI - check last 7,14,21,30 or whatever days. Ask yourself..."" does this adset deserve a last chance?""If yes - leave it. If no - KILL IT.



Makes sense?



Any other variable from Phase 3 is treated the same way as a test from phase 1 and 2. Only interests are different.



Publishing in P3 is also a little different. In phases 1 and 2 we launch ads and we let them run for 6XKPI - then we kill anything that is not within or close to KPI. In phase 3 because optimisation is different - publishing is also different. 



One of the rules here says that we always want to spend the most on what is already proven. That means that, at this point, we want to be spending more on P3 compared to other phases. That is not always possible of course - it depends on the results you get from previous tests. So here's how to publish new ads in Phase 3...



First thing we need to do is see how many adsets will be running tomorrow. We call these guaranteed. Check today - if it is within KPI you can select it as guarantee. This means that we know for a fact that this adset won't be optimised tomorrow. If its not within KPI we are going to check the last 2,5 days including

today.



And then you are going to ask yourself the very important questions:



""If results remain the same, would I let that run tomorrow or would I optimise it?""



Select it as a guarantee if you would let it run. Then you need to check how many guarantees you have of this creative. We want to have a minimum if its not working well but no less than 2 adsets and we want to have up to 6 maximum if its working well. You add as many new adsets as needed depending on the performance. Make sure the creative you are adding is not already scaled in Phase 4 scaling campaign. When something is in a scaling campaign you stop adding it here or anywhere for that matter.



And thats it with Phase 3…



I know this is a lot but we are almost there…



Phase 4 - Scaling



So far we should have:  
  


* An angle that works - discoverable in Phase 1
*   A visual creative that works - discoverable in Phase 2
*   A few interests that work - discoverable in Phase 3





All of these are the main building blocks of a scaling campaign.



We start by finding what has been working consistently well in Phase 3. 



Then we need to decide what type of CBO we are going to create - this depends on what we have available.



The 3 types of scaling CBO campaigns are:



1.   One creative with the 3 best possible interests - lets say we have a creative that is working really well - you simply select the 3 best interests and create a new CBO campaign. This will allow Meta to spend the budget however it sees fit across these 3 different interests. Because these 3 interests are already proven we can now allow Meta to do whatever it wants.
2.   Multiple good creatives - we can do 2 good creatives with 2 interests each.
3.   BROAD CBO - If we want to scale more we can do a massive daily budget with a cost cap. This tells facebook that it can spend as much as it wants from the huge daily budget as long as the cost per result is below our goal.





So...Based on the current situation inside of the account you can decide which one of these options you wanna pick. Bare in mind that in many cases, even though everything was tested and done according to the click magnetic process, every time you try to scale there is a chance that it will break. 



Meaning that, there is no guarantee that your scaling attempt will be successful. 



Thats why when it comes to scaling I prefer calling it a scaling attempt.



We let the CBO run for 3 days with whatever daily budget we have set. You will see I dont say 3xKPI or anything like that. Reason being is that the budget of the CBO can be significantly higher. Let is spend for 3 days.



*   Then go ahead and check yesterday. If its good - leave it.
*   If its not - check today.
*   If not - check the day before yesterday.
*   If not check last 7,14,30 or whatever days.
*   We really wanna find a reason for this to live.
*   We are not trying to get rid of it fast. The opposite. We want it to live.



And thats it…



So in conclusion:



*   Your goal as a media buyer is to spend the advertising budget you have access to in the best possible way
*   You are essentially an investor on behalf of your client (or yourself)
*   Your goal is to identify variables that will deliver a campaign within KPI
*   The Click-magnetic media buying process is a 4 phase process designed to identify winning variables
*   Phase 1 is message/angle/idea
*   Phase 2 is ad variables test (visual, headline, copy and etc.)
*   Phase 3 is adset variable test (targeting, interests, age, gender...)
*   Phase 4 is a scaling CBO campaign
*   Every phase has 2 processes in it - publishing and optimisation.
*   They vary depending on the phase (some are the same)

Moving Back into traditional advertising from Influencer?,cpsg1995,0,5,2024-07-13 14:24:41,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1e2bmpg/moving_back_into_traditional_advertising_from/,0,0,"Hi all - just looking some advice &amp; perspective. 

I'm a strategist in LA  (29M) - been in the industry for about 6 years. In that time I've worked in one creative shop, one experiential shop, and one influencer-led shop (where I'm at currently). 

I've received an offer from a bigger influencer/creator-focused shop for a strategy director position and a lot more money. While I'm interested in the creator/influencer space as I think it's new and has room for growth &amp; innovation, I'm concerned that If I take it I will have difficulty moving back into the traditional creative agency space later in my career - essentially painting myself in a corner/niche that I'm not 100% sold-in on. 

For this round of job hunting, I applied to several creative shops but only heard back from influencer-forward ones which concerns me. Just looking for some outside perspective. 

Thank you",self,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1e2bmpg/moving_back_into_traditional_advertising_from/

Final Fantasy 9 lets you pause the game whenever you want. During exploration, overworld exploration, battles, boss battles and even all the cutscenes. You can press start and the game will just stop executing with a PAUSE screen overlayed on it. 

It seems a minor thing but this is a great feature. Gamers are human beings with things to do outside of gaming. Having the possibility to PAUSE is an incredible quality of life feature. 

I notice that many modern have a problem with this. Especially cutscenes, you often aren't allowed to pause them and have to sit through or skip them. There is no reason why a single player game shouldn't have a ""pause anytime"" feature.

At the beginning, it ""overwhelms"" you with a hard to navigate world and a lot of characters who want a lot of things, but because of that, you never focus completely on one task (like collecting shells for example), so you just run around, meet friends, have fun, and progress whatever goals you've set for yourself. The music is gorgeous, the graphics are nice, and the writing ranges from beautiful and melancholic to genuinely hilarious (a guy gives you rumors, on the third interaction, he says ""wanna hear some rumors?"" you say yes, then he says ""im out"" and you say ""its ok"" which is very different from the gamey omniscient hint systems we've gotten in games). You become more capable of moving around, create shortcuts with the stuff you acquire along the way, and learn the layout of this wonderful little world in 1-3 hours. I highly recommend it.

**About Hundreds of Beavers:**

HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS was filmed over the pandemic in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and surrounding areas (including Michigan) by a small crew on a budget of approximately $150,000. After filming, director Mike Cheslik painstakingly executed over 1500 effects shots on his home computer.

After a virtual premiere at Fantastic Fest in 2022, the movie gained steam on the festival circuit, picking up a slew of awards including an audience award at Fantasia 2023. With no major offers from distributors, the filmmakers decided to self-release the film, starting with the ""Great Lakes Roadshow"" in early 2024: a 14-day tour of the Midwest which sold out most screens, including a 700+ audience at the Music Box in Chicago. The show hearkened back to early vaudeville, with Mike Cheslik roasting the audience and the movies star / producer / co-writer Ryland Tews body-slamming beavers.

The New York Times picked up the story, and from there Hundreds of Beavers became an unexpected cult hit in cinemas across the country. So far it has played on over 250 screens (we only showed up to 26 of em), and is currently premiering in the UK, Australia, Taiwan, and more.

To get the film on VOD, we partnered with FilmHub, a distribution company that allows filmmakers to keep their rights, for transactional video on demand via Amazon and Apple. We also brokered a partnership with Fandor for subscription streaming.

We are also proud to announce that **Hundreds of Beavers** will be the FIRST FILM to be screened at the LIBRARY OF CONGRESS in the same year as its theatrical release. Saturday, July 27th.

We will attempt to screen in movie theaters as long as fans want it. Follow along at [hundredsofbeavers.com](http://hundredsofbeavers.com/)

Prominent characters that became less important in the sequels,AporiaParadox,786,949,2024-07-17 12:51:33,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e5hf5j/prominent_characters_that_became_less_important/,786,0,"Usually when a sequel comes around, you expect to see the same main and supporting characters show up, especially if they're popular. But sometimes the creators can't think of anything for those characters to do in the new plot they've come up with, or there's new characters competing for screentime, or maybe the actors are just too busy.

As such, the old characters are there basically out of obligation, but don't actually get to do anything important, or are much less important than they used to be. This is especially a problem in movie series with huge ensemble casts. Sometimes they just show up for a cameo near the end of the movie and only have a few lines of dialogue, and sometimes they show up for a cameo at the start of the movie solely to die.

So what movie characters just became irrelevant in sequels?",self,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e5hf5j/prominent_characters_that_became_less_important/

Anyway I was surprised to learn from the sound effects editor that the original script called for The CEO to have a deep, animalistic barking voice, but the editor found that boring and experimented until he found that it worked better making literal baby noises. I really thought the baby noises were such a key component of the infantilizing nature of being an oligarch, the condescension of corporate copy, that I couldn't imagine the scene any other way. This was after being told repeatedly what a singular, personal vision Phil Tippett had for the entire project. Made me wonder how much else of the movie was essentially him taking suggestions from his crew over the years.

How dare they play the triumphant music after the movie ends...


Oh god where to start. I didn't know this was a Kubrick movie. I'm sure he wouldn't want me to know either. I read about the troubled production of this masterpiece. Kubrick clashed with everyone. Kirk Douglas was very involved wih both direction and production.


Speaking of Douglas, he looks so feeble and weary in the begining of the movie. Truely like a wrinkled and sun beaten slave. Hell of a performance he gave. Anytime he tears up he burns you to the core with those glistening blue eyes.


The OST is so distinctively memorable. Especially the love theme of Spartacus. That melancholic flute that has been sampled hundreds of times.


There were so many extras in this. Holy shit. That war scene where the Roman legions are marching to formation is spine chilling. There are so many people.


Man, what an emotional story. Shakespearean. Gut wrenching. Perhaps one of the most legendary tales of defeat in media. It was difficult to not weep after the war scenes. It's just sadness after sadness. Also the death of &gt;!Draba &amp; Antonious are both really impactful. The staredown in the waiting booth between Draba &amp; Spartacus is just torture when you know the context!&lt;


You know, it's odd how for such a recognizable name like Spartacus and the message of that story, all the modern interpretations put their focus on the sex and gladiatorial combat aspects.

Is he choosing to face his guilt or trying to avoid it? Do you think he wants to die as a ""monster"" because he can't live with what he's done, or is there another reason?I'm really curious to hear what others think about this line and how you interpreted the ending.

Pair some known duos together for it. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. Bring in Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, etc. Throw some bigger names like Bradley Cooper, Steve Carell, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, etc. in.

I started this journey on July 10, 2024 

EDITED I AM GOING TO post this in parts  so this is part one and part two should be soon and I am going to add a date 
 
And I am doing a nick scale now 


 The Best of Times. It was somewhat hard to find but I found it on the Internet Archive I will give it a 10 
not much to say about it 

Fast Times at Ridgemont High. nick was in it once very briefly. it didn’t really have nick in it so I was a bit disappointed in that but not thinking of it as a nick cage movie I would give it a 5 I am reviewing them off how much I like them how good of a movie I think they are and how good nick was on a nick scale 1 

The Outsiders 7


Valley Girl. 7. it was pretty good 

Rumble Fish 6. It was a little bit hard to find but I found it on YouTube 

Racing with the Moon 8 it was pretty good 

The Cotton Club 5. It was okay 

Birdy 9 I thought it was really good 

The Boy in Blue. 10.  this movie was so hard to find you would not believe it. And it was the best Row Boating movie I have ever watched note it is the only Row Boating movie I have seen but still I thought it was good 
 

Peggy Sue Got Married 7 because of nicks voice the movie was funny 

Raising Arizona 10  it was funny and all around a pretty good movie 

Moonstruck 6

Never on Tuesday 2. The 2 stars are for the 2 seconds nicks was in it his small scene was pretty funny the rest of the movie was bad 

Vampire's Kiss 10 I love it it was very funny 

Time to Kill 3 why was it made in the first place the movie is really messed up 

Fire Birds 6 it was okay 

Wild at Heart 10 it was funny and nick sings 2 elvis songs 

Wish me luck this is going to be a long journey 


I will keep everybody updated and would love to know if anyone else has done this please do not spoil any of the movies.

AI DJX, Daily Mix, song radio, Smart Shuffle, *all* of them play the exact. same. shit. over. and. over. and. over again.

You get the point. I'm not sure what changes they made to the algorithm, or why for that matter, but whatever they did it has nearly crippled my ability to discover new music, save for Discover Weekly. Even then though, it feels like DW has been missing a lot more than it hits lately too.

At least Release Radar still got me. Can't fuck up new releases from artists I follow. Would have to be some of the worst coders on the planet to mess that one up.

EDIT: Clearing the cache has improved things significantly, along with turning off automix. Spotify is trying to cut on server costs by caching the songs on your device and then replaying them endlessly, all while increasing prices.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1190,1,2023-06-26 16:48:31,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1190,0,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.
